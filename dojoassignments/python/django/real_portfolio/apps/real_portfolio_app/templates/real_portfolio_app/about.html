        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Now this is the story all about how My life got flipped, turned upside down,
             And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air.
              In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground where I spent most of my days Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool,
               And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good,
                Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
                 And said you're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air I begged and pleaded with her the other day,
                  But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kissin' and she gave me my ticket,
                   I put my Walkman on and said I might as well kick it First class, yo this is bad, Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass,
                    Is this what the people of Bel Air livin' like Hm this might be alright! I whistled for a cab and when it came near,
                     the License plate said 'Fresh' and had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare,
                      But I thought now forget it, yo home to Bel Air I pulled up to a house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie,
                       yo Holmes smell ya later Looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air
